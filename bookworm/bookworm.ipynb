    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will build a simple question-answering agent that is able to learn from any text data you provide, and answer queries posed in natural language. You will use IBM Watson's cloud-based services to process the input text data and find relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a cloud-based NLP service instance and configure it.\n",
    "- Ingest a set of text documents using the service and analyze the results.\n",
    "- Accept questions in natural language and parse them.\n",
    "- Find relevant answers from the preprocessed text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use Watson's cloud-based services, you first need to create an account on the [IBM Bluemix platform](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/).\n",

Note that Watson treats each \"document\" as a unit of text that is returned as the result of a query. But we want to retrieve a paragraph of text for each question. So, let's split each file up into individual paragraphs. We will use the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library for this purpose.\n",

Open one of the files in a text editor to see how the paragraphs are delimited using `<p>...</p>` tags - this is how the code block below split paragraphs into separate \"documents\"._"

    "In order to understand questions posed in natural language, we'll use another Watson service called [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/conversation/index.html). It can be used to design conversational agents or _chatbots_ that exhibit complex behavior, but for the purpose of this project, we'll only use it to parse certain kinds of queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a Conversation service instance\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like you did for the Discovery service, create an instance of the Conversation service. Then launch the associated tool from the service dashboard.\n",

    "\n",
    "A _workspace_ allows you to keep all the items you need for a particular application in one place, just like an _environment_ in case of the Discovery service. Create one called \"Bookworm\" with a suitable description, such as \"I know a lot of stories. Ask me a question!\"\n",

    "### Add intents\n",
    "\n",
    "An _intent_ is the goal or purpose of a user's input. Create a set of intents (at least 3) that capture the different kinds of questions that you want the system to answer, e.g. _who_, _what_ and _where_. Along with each intent, add a list of user examples or _utterances_ that map to that intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, you could enter the following examples for the _where_ intent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Where is the Jedi temple located?\n",
    "- Where was Luke born?\n",

    "### Add entities\n",

    "Once you have your intents set, let's tell the service what entities we want it to identify. One way to do this is using the tool interface, and entering them one-by-one.\n",

    "**Q**: Now that you have gone through this exercise of designing a system that uses two IBM Watson services, what did you learn? What were some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: \n",
    "I learned integration and usage of IBM Watson services( Discovery and conversation).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Easy to integrate and reasonably documented. Without much depth underlying technology, any can easily use and integrate NLP services. In the past, I have used conversation services like API.AI, Google NLP services. Even though it's not a direct comparison, I do feel IBM Watson conversation services along with discovery services under a single umbrella provides a lot of information such as relations, sentiment, keywords, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: For providing end to end solution, it till requires some manual handling. For example the above dialog conversation, I have handled the scenario where we have trigger point who and actions. But if it was who trigger point alone, I need to have managed it slightly different. So it requires some case by case handling, in at least on some level. I also see another Watson services called Tone analyzer which is beta, which is again a value add. So different services will again provide a great resource for NLP. But since service is readily avalibale, we loose flexibiity to change the way, data is analyzed an parsed or to consider different approach. In long run, it creates dependency and clearly loose control over the code.\n",

    "## (Optional) Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided a set of sample data files containing Star Wars plot summaries. But as mentioned before, you are free to use your own dataset. In fact, a larger dataset maybe more suitable for use with IBM Watson's NLP services. If you used your own dataset, answer the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: What dataset did you use, and in what ways is it different from the sample files provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q**: Either include your dataset in the .zip file or repository you submit, or provide clear instructions on how to obtain the dataset, so that your reviewer can run your notebook or inspect the data to verify your results.\n",
